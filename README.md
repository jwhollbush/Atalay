# Cuda Lib AMD HD 5450 GPU 
i have (2) AMD HD 5450 Graphic cards for temp use mining after bricking my main card in windows 10,now i have a problem which is open CL error is deprecated for these cards, i checked settings in my bios mode and the cards are not recognized by system resource as GPU and not appearing that way in task manager either which is the same as the Nvidea before I decided it was bricked, from slight over clocking while mining $ETH and other SHA-256 algos but still this issue is bewildering and the open CL function not available on these other two cards is confusing the differential diagosis, please help me in this regardmif at all possible. I could offer a small bounty in $EOS, $Tron, or $XLM.

012.020.000.050

Graphics Chipset
